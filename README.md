### iPhone 15 Product Launch Perception

#### Project Objective:
The main aim of this project is to analyze public sentiment and perception regarding the launches of iPhone 14 and iPhone 15. This involves two significant tasks:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluating public opinion on iPhone 14 and 15 launches through comments, reviews, and discussions. This analysis categorizes sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.

2. **Topic Modeling**: Identifying key topics and themes from discussions related to iPhone 14 and 15. This involves uncovering the most discussed aspects and features of these product launches.

#### Methodology:
- **Data Collection**: Extraction of comments and discussions from various platforms, particularly focusing on iPhone-related discussions. For instance, Reddit comments are collected using PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) and stored in CSV files for analysis.

- **Data Analysis Techniques**: Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment analysis and topic modeling. This includes techniques like:
    - Sentiment scoring of comments
    - Identification of prevalent themes and subjects

#### Tools and Libraries Used:
- PRAW for data collection from Reddit
- Vader for sentiment analysis
- LDA and BERT for topic modelling

#### Results and Discussion:
The analysis of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 product launches revealed a range of public sentiments and perceptions:

- **iPhone 14**: The launch was met with approval regarding Apple's innovative design approach, such as the introduction of 'Dynamic Island'. However, there were notable concerns about the product's pricing in European markets and questions about the value proposition considering the incremental nature of the upgrades. The discontinuation of the iPhone Mini and its potential effects on the Android market were also points of significant discussion.

- **iPhone 15**: The reaction continued to be mixed. While the matte finish and the retention of 'Dynamic Island' design were positive aspects, many expressed a desire for advanced features like higher refresh rate screens. Discussions also reflected on the broader trend of iPhone evolution, with some sentiment suggesting that the excitement of new launches has waned due to the perceived incremental updates.

#### Conclusion:
Overall, the analysis through sentiment analysis and topic modeling has provided a nuanced view of the iPhone 14 and 15 launches, offering insights into consumer preferences and areas that could be leveraged for future improvements.
